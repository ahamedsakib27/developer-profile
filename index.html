            <h3>I am a professional web developer</h3>
            <p>Hi! I am Farhana Kahter Falguni, a web designer/developer focused on crafting great web experience
                Designing
                and
                Coding havebeen my passion since the days I started working with computers but I found myself into web
                design/development since 2022. I enjoy creating beautifully designed, intuitive and functional
                websites.I am curious, and I enjoy work that challenges me to learn something new and stretch in a
                different direction. I do my
                best to stay on top of changes in the state of the art so that I can meet challenges with tools well
                suited to the job
                at hand. The list of projects I follow on GitHub will give you a good idea of the types of tools I would
                prefer to be using,
                and my Instapaper “Starred” list will give you a glimpse into the reading material I find interesting
                enough to share.

                I already learned the basic HTML and CSS. I can build any simple website. I can even teach my grandma
                how to make simple
                website. My goal is to build 3 websites and learn advanced topics.

                    I am the master of HTML, CSS and Javascript. I know everything needed to make a website function,
                    efficient. I didn't
                    stop with the web. I went beyond with most popular Javascript framework called Vue JS. I even know
                    the
                    deployment,
                    server and security. I will give you 100% web solution.

                    They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remove web developer. I made their website and
                    showed
                    it to them.
                    They liked it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming Hero.
