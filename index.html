            <h3>I am a professional web developer</h3>
            <p>Hi! I am Farhana Kahter Falguni, a web designer/developer focused on crafting great web experience
                Designing
                and
                Coding havebeen my passion since the days I started working with computers but I found myself into web
                design/development since 2022. I enjoy creating beautifully designed, intuitive and functional
                websites.I am curious, and I enjoy work that challenges me to learn something new and stretch in a
                different direction. I do my
                best to stay on top of changes in the state of the art so that I can meet challenges with tools well
                suited to the job
                at hand. The list of projects I follow on GitHub will give you a good idea of the types of tools I would
                prefer to be using,
                and my Instapaper “Starred” list will give you a glimpse into the reading material I find interesting
                enough to share.
            </p>
